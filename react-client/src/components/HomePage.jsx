									<p>This little pup came crawling into our research camp in the Okavango, unable to walk, but full of love and seeking help.  She was severely injured, with her back legs completely immobilized. Our area has both  predators and livestock, and we don't know how she was injured, but it's amazing she survived and made her way to us. She is bursting with the sweetest spirit. We drove her to the nearest veterinary clinic, an 8-hour drive on terrible roads and ferry crossing over the Okavango River. 

									We've named her Poppy. 

									From her x-rays, it seems two of her discs are crushed, and she needs surgery to survive. Her chances are relatively slim, and the surgery is $2,000-$3,000. If she makes it, and we are hoping hoping hoping and trusting trusting trusting she will, she will need a lot of post-op care. 

									She will be going into surgery soon. If you can spare $5-$10 or more, every dollar will help. If you are giving to other causes or just don't have the money, could you please invest your positive energy, love, healing vibes, strength, affirmations, prayers, meditation, or whatever you do to reach a higher power, and send it to Poppy?

									Thank you, with love, amanda
