# Bstow_Test

Crowdfunding website, test done for Bstow. Possibilities to edit a campaign, and view the different donor profiles.
To run this website please follow the following steps:

1. Download this repository to a local directory.

```ruby
git clone https://github.com/camilaaortega/Bstow_Test.git
```

2. Run the following commands in the terminal, both at the same time in different tabs.

```
npm run react-dev
npm run server-dev
```

3. Enter your localhost through your web browser. I had this edited to http://localhost:8080/ but this may change according to local configurations.
